# reva-hack1
with help of wix,html widgets and javascript ,We tried to build a webpage that helps people to check their mental health.We have designed a survey cum quiz; that on basis of user's answer, publish and analyze a report that tells if user is at higher risk or at lower risk of depressive disorders.and if the person is not feeling well ,he/she can follow suggestive steps or can choose to address their problems by clicking on contact icons that will lead them to toll free helpline numbers for psychological problems.It is useful for normal person as well as for those who r undergoing some depressive disorders.Further  modifications can be done by embedding a feature that allows user to book an appointment with a therapist.
